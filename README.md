## The Big Three


### [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) - [Official Site](https://reactjs.org/)

[![GitHub forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/facebook/react.svg?style=flat-square)]()
[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/facebook/react.svg?style=flat-square)]()

A declarative, component-based, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces, as opposed to a full framework like Angular. Concerns like routing, state management and data fetching have been left to third parties. This has resulted in a large and very active ecosystem around React.


### [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) - [Official Site](https://angular.io/)

[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/angular/angular.svg?style=flat-square)]()
[![GitHub forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/angular/angular.svg?style=flat-square)]()
[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/angular/angular.svg?style=flat-square)]()

One framework. Mobile & desktop.  It is a full-featured and opinionated framework that provides defaults for data fetching, state management, development language, and build toolchain. Perhaps the most notable feature of Angular is its use of TypeScript as the development language. This has made the framework well-suited to those coming from traditional object-oriented languages like Java and C#, as TypeScript takes inspiration from those languages. 


### [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) - [Official Site](https://vuejs.org/)

[![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/vuejs/vue.svg?style=flat-square)]()

The Progressive JavaScript Framework. It is widely considered to be the easiest to learn. It is similar to React in many respects, but also has things in common with AngularJS â€” for example, directives and templates. Vue's relative simplicity, developer experience, and good performance have contributed to a huge surge in its popularity.
