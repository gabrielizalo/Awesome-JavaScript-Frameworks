## The Big Three


### [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) - [Official Site](https://reactjs.org/)

[![GitHub forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/facebook/react.svg?style=flat-square)]()
[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/facebook/react.svg?style=flat-square)]()

A declarative, component-based, efficient, and flexible JavaScript 
library for building user interfaces, as opposed to a full framework 
like Angular. Concerns like routing, state management and data fetching 
have been left to third parties. This has resulted in a large and very 
active ecosystem around React.


### [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) - [Official Site](https://vuejs.org/)

[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/vuejs/vue.svg?style=flat-square)]()

The Progressive JavaScript Framework. It is widely considered to be the 
easiest to learn. It is similar to React in many respects, but also has 
things in common with AngularJS â€” for example, directives and templates. 
Vue's relative simplicity, developer experience, and good performance 
have contributed to a huge surge in its popularity. 


### [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) - [Official Site](https://angular.io/)

[![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/angular/angular.svg?style=flat-square)]()

[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/angular/angular.svg?style=flat-square)]()

One framework. Mobile & desktop.  It is a full-featured and opinionated 
framework that provides defaults for data fetching, state management, 
development language, and build toolchain. Perhaps the most notable 
feature of Angular is its use of TypeScript as the development language. 
This has made the framework well-suited to those coming from traditional 
object-oriented languages like Java and C#, as TypeScript takes 
inspiration from those languages. 


## Historically Significant


### [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js) - [Official Site](https://angularjs.org/)

[![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/angular/angular.js.svg?style=flat-square)]()
[![GitHub tag](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/angular/angular.js.svg?style=flat-square)]()
[![GitHub watchers](https://img.shields.io/github/watchers/angular/angular.js.svg?style=flat-square)]()
[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/angular/angular.js.svg?style=flat-square)]()
[![GitHub forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/angular/angular.js.svg?style=flat-square)]()
[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/angular/angular.js.svg?style=flat-square)]()

In 2013, AngularJS was the most popular framework. Some of the factors 
contributing to its popularity during that period were its MVC 
architecture, declarative programming style, two-way data binding, 
and robust feature set. AngularJS has an opinionated approach and aims 
to provide developers with a complete solution. Despite the growth of 
its successor project, AngularJS is still widely used and is in active 
development.


### [Backbone](http://github.com/jashkenas/backbone) - [Official Site](http://backbonejs.org/)

[![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/jashkenas/backbone.svg?style=flat-square)]()
[![GitHub tag](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/jashkenas/backbone.svg?style=flat-square)]()
[![GitHub watchers](https://img.shields.io/github/watchers/jashkenas/backbone.svg?style=flat-square)]()
[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/jashkenas/backbone.svg?style=flat-square)]()
[![GitHub forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/jashkenas/backbone.svg?style=flat-square)]()
[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/jashkenas/backbone.svg?style=flat-square)]()

Authored by Jeremy Ashkenas, who also created CoffeeScript, Backbone 
was initially released in the fall of 2010. A key part of the Backbone 
ecosystem is Marionette, a framework that simplifies development. 
Backbone is significant because it was one of the first frameworks to 
bring more structure to front end applications by implementing a MVC 
pattern. In recent years Backbone has seen a decline in usage, although 
it continues to be shipped in the latest version of the Drupal content 
management system. 


### [Ember](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) - [Official Site](https://www.emberjs.com/)

[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/emberjs/ember.js.js.svg?style=flat-square)]()

Ember was authored by Yehuda Katz, a prolific creator or contributor to 
numerous open source projects. Ember is based on the MVVM pattern and 
has a rich feature set. One of the major criticisms of Ember is its 
large size, which has a negative impact on performance. Ember is also 
viewed as having a steep learning curve and difficult to master.
